The Inevitable Death of Uber
============================


[*"Now that Uber doesn't have a CEO, COO, CTO, or CFO, I guess this is the closest it's ever been to a self-driving car company"*](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6280583287664705536).

The latest joke going around the internet is not what I am going to talk about.

The death of Uber is not about the toxic culture of one company, but rather the inevitable automation of an entire industry.

Imagine a future where every car is fully autonomous. This is not so much a question of *if* this future will happen, so much as *when* it will happen. Thus when every car (not just your autonomous Uber) is capable of driving you from point A to point B, what is stopping any legacy car manufacturer from mimicking Uber's business model?

A future where a parked Ford or Lexus is available for public use is not far off. These cars would be capable of driving the user in the safest, and most efficent way, and then drive itself back to a spot designated by the manufacturer (perhaps a spot in the city known for high demand).

Uber's biggest competitive advantage is its network of drivers available on demand anywhere in the city. In a future where every driver is a machine, this advantage is gone. Any car manufacturer could set up a network of "drivers" and quickly reach the consumer.

Uber's business will be disrupted, and when the arms race for self driving cars begins, you will be hardpressed to find a single Uber in sight.
