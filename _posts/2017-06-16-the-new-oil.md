When Google search engine started back in 1997, advertisers laughed at the idea of putting content on the internet. Who would see these ads except for perhaps a few bankers or academics? Then, something strange happened. Google changed the search engine forever. By using an algorithmic that sorted websites based on user data, Google created a website that constantly improved with each use. Every click made the search engine better. If we compare cars, Google was a fuel efficient car with unlimited oil refills, and Yahoo...a clunker.

The reality of data today is far different, far scarier. I can look at a watch on Amazon at 5:00pm, and expect to go to my favorite search engine and find an advertisement for that same watch at 5:01pm. Going back on Amazon at 5:02, I search for a wallet. Then on the other side of the world, a person who views the same watch as me is instantly suggested that he may like the wallet I just viewed. Scary stuff.

Now let's take Uber. How can data improve their business? Uber can track ride usage for a month, find that the most popular spot is New York City, find that within NYC, Midtown has the most Uber requests, and of those people requesting Uber's about 42% of them are white males between the ages of 18 and 35. Uber could then use big data to find places in Midtown men of this demographic would probably frequent, such as popular bars in Midtown, and use Google AdWords to give a search result titled "Get home safe. $5 off your next Uber when using promo code XYZ" every time someone within the target demographic looks up that popular bar spot.

Big data allows companies to target market segments in ways that will be most likely to appeal to them. It allows feedback on which marketing strategies are successful and to what extent they are. Big data is not oil. It is Oxygen. The age of "winging it" is gone, for a business to survive in 2017, it must beÂ powered by data.
