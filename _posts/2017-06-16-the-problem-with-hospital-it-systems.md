The Problem with Hospital IT Systems
====================================


Libraries. Banks. Universities. Even fast food. Almost every operation you can think of has been transformed by adopting the latest technology. That is with one strange exception: hospitals. Of all the industries listed, surely when lives are at stake that is when the need to advance technology is most urgent?

Yet, hospital IT systems are notoriously outdated and complex. Doctors hate them. Time spent logging data into an online form multiple times is time that could be spent elsewhere in the hospital. Many of these systems limit permission to the doctor, so tasks that were once the job of the physician assistant or nurse are now the exclusive responsibility of the doctor.

Now keep in mind that these IT systems were not made nearly as user friendly as Steve Job's iPhone. They are old, Windows XP old, and have counter intuitive interfaces, which often experience bugs and glitches that require doctors to constantly reenter data. When these systems are prone to mistakes it has very real consequences. When an doctor who is not very tech savvy means to click one patient's box icon but ends up clicking a box right next to it, the result could be one patient's drug recommendation being subscribed to the other.

Another problem with these IT systems is that they are hard to implement, and training for these systems occurs in efficient ways. For example, a hospital that holds lecture sessions might be effective for some tech-savvy doctors, however, it lacks the personal attention needed for doctors who might be less comfortable with technology.

Overall, what we are seeing is the bureaucratization of the hospital. When patient lives are at stake, the decision for hospital IT suppliers to be content with delivering subpar solutions is unacceptable. A new system is needed, one that is user friendly and intuitive, andÂ *makes the job of doctors easier --- not harder*. Yes it is hard to innovate in an industry that demands such precision, but our hospitals and their patients deserve nothing less.
