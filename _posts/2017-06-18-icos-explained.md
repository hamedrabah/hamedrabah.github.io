*ICO --- Inital Coin offering.*

You may have heard about the new trend called ICOs and in light of all the existing cryptocurrencies, making sense of this new trend can get confusing. I am going to help clear things up.

Currencies such as the USD, GBP, etc. have 3 main purposes.

1\. Currency is a means of valuation. If I want to know the price of something I use this definition of currency to value it.

2\. Currency is also a means of storing value. Instead of having my bank account say 3 coconuts, 5 clam shells, and 2 pencils it says the amount they are worth in dollars.

3\. Currency as a medium of exchange. Our economy does not rely on mutual needs. If I am a plumber I can get a haircut using money, instead of relying on my barber to have a broken sink and give me a haircut in exchange for my plumbing services. Somebody who does need a plumber can pay with a form of currency that is accepted by both me and my barber.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc. are better thought of as analogus to currency in its 3 purposes: storing value, measuring value, and exchanging value.

Apple stock, while worth money, would not be a good currency because not everybody has a need or desire for apple stock, it is harder to liquidate, and valuing items in terms of apple stock would get confusing. Imagine going to the (Amazon) grocery store and seeing an pear priced at 1/110th of an apple stock.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are better than stocks as a means of currency, although still far from perfect, largely because of constantly fluctuating exchange rates (this can and most likely will be fixed when governments decide to adopt an official cryptocurrency backed by the government and built on blockchain (ex. digital gold storing the value of gold online using blockchain, crypto US treasury bonds, national currencies, etc. ). Still, in the digital world these are as close as we have come to money (thus far) so we use Bitcoin as a way to value items, store our worth, and exchange goods and services.

So where do ICOs come in?

Just like you can buy equity in a company using the medium of a US dollar, you can buy equity in a company (that uses an ICO) using a cryptocurrency (usually Bitcoin) to buy their coin. The coin (or token as they are commonly called) typically represent equity in the company and let you share in the profits, although this is not always the case.

[Golem](https://golem.network/) is one of the more exciting projects in the decentralized apps ("Dapps") community. The developers at Golem are building a decentralized network of computers that provide computing power and give the user access to the network to use the supercomputer. The main applications of this are for universities and academia, where a professor would be able to acccess a supercomputer on a basic laptop by having all the power intensive calculations taking place in computers abroad and then transferred to the basic computer. In the case of Golem, people who participated in the ICO were awarded Golem tokens (aka coins) that rather than equity, represent accesss to use the computing network, with the amount of time proportional to the number of tokens owned.

Another exciting ICO is the [Basic Attention Token (BAT)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/). BAT is a protocal that advertisers can use to take into account how engaged a consumer was with an advertisment. Was the Youtube ad watched for 15 seconds or 50? What if one person watched it for 15.24 seconds and another for 15.25? Yep. The BAT can take that into account. Although this sounds like it would only be benefitial to enterprise, it is also benefitial to everyday consumers, who would be treated to less frequent ads of a better quality, that are more engaging and interesting to them.

At the present most ICOs and Dapps are admittedly unimpressive. It is also worrisome that people will throw money at anything that has an ICO. One coin called "[ponzicoin](https://ponzico.win/)" says on its [whitepaper](https://ponzico.win/ponzico.pdf) "Let's just cut to the case". Ponzicoin is a good depiction of about where 90% of ICO money goes, and that is down the toilet.

But it is that other 10% that really excites me. It is the next generation of the internet. Decentralized apps promise to be the greatest change the internet has seen since it was created, and ICOs are an exciting way to be a part of it.

Just be aware of the risks.
