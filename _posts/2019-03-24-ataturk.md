Ataturk by [M. Şükrü Hanioğlu](https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22M.+%C5%9E%C3%BCkr%C3%BC+Hanio%C4%9Flu%22)

Ataturk is an interesting figure in modern history. Today he is claimed to support ideologies as diverse as secular scientism all the way to fundamental Islamism. Political parties in Turkey all claim Ataturk as one of their own. There is a certain cult of personality around him that makes it hard to discern the facts from the myths. [Hanioğlu](https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22M.+%C5%9E%C3%BCkr%C3%BC+Hanio%C4%9Flu%22) does a fantastic job challenging core tenants around the cult of Ataturk and providing a fair, balanced, and well researched biography.

## The Young Turk

Mustafa Kemal (famously known today as Ataturk --- "father of Turks") was born into a lower middle class Muslim family in the Ottoman Empire. Lower classes tended to get a more religious education in Islam and Arabic, upper classes modeled curriculum after the Europeans and focused more on French and the sciences. Kemal's parents embodied this divide, his mother wanted him to get a religious education, his father a European one.

His father died when he was just 7 and for a young Mustafa the only hope of class mobility was to attend a military school. Ottoman military school borrowed heavily from the Germans and was a mostly secular European education to learn the latest military tactics, with some lip service paid to religion classes. The German style education was influenced by social Darwinism, and a young Ataturk learned a strong military is needed for the longevity of nation. But what good is a strong army, without an equally strong flag to rally behind?

## Istanbul not Constantinople

At the same time Mustafa was receiving his education, Muslims in the Ottoman Empire were becoming economically disenfranchised. In an effort to restore the economic power of the ailing Empire, Ottoman trade policy strongly favored the Christian population (Greeks, Albanians, Chaldeans, etc). Amongst other reasons this contributed to a sense of divide for the Turkish population in the Empire. Mustafa also a strong ethno-national identity as important in motivating an army to fight, seeing the decaying Empire, Kemal reasoned a multi-ethnic army fighting for an empire didn't have the same motivation.

When Ataturk became the founder and president of the Turkish Republic he sought to cement the idea of Turkish nationalism in contrast with Islamic and Ottoman identities. Islam was an "Arab" religion, not a Turkish one. Ataturk even sought to use pseudoscience and pseudolinguistic studies to justify Turkish nationalism. He funded studies claiming the Turkish language is actually one of the first languages of civilization (the so called "sun language theory") and that all languages originate from Turkish (to justify a connection to Europe --- although this same supposed origin story wasn't used to connect to the 'barbaric' Arabic language).

Another "study" looked at skeletal remains of Turks/Europeans to draw a supposed common lineage. One might wonder if Ataturk ever saw the irony in pushing a secular and scientific education on Turkey, but using a pseudoscience in creating a shared Turkish nationalism. Nationalism was the new religion of the Turks.

Another step in enshrining Turkish identity was the removal of Arabic script from the Turkish language and using Latinf script instead. Ataturk made an effort to remove as many Arabic and Persian loan words from the language as possible, and ended up creating a language so different from Ottoman Turkish that dictionaries had to be published translating between Ottoman and Turkish.

Ataturk was also loved by the masses. He was a hero of war. He was the founder of a nation. For a man fighting the worship of idols, he became such an idol of worship. Amongst the cults cultivated by Ataturk: reason, republicanism, and Kemalism --- the latter is the most ironic.

## A secularist, a Communist, and an Islamist?

A really interesting application of text mining a historical figure's speeches: from 1920--1923 Ataturk mentioned certain key religious words 792 times. In the the 6 years following he mentioned those same words half as much and in double the amount of years. The same holds true to his references to Marxist lexicography. So why the sudden interest in Islam and Marxism by Ataturk, and why the sudden withdrawal afterwards?

In 1918, following the end of WW1, Woodrow Wilson published his 14 points. The points called for the liberation of countries from colonialism, and for the establishment of ethno-national states (the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire). Peculiarly the Kurds were not part of such discussions, and the ramifications are still being discovered today, nearly 100 years later. While the post WW1 allied powers were plotting to weaken the sick man of Europe, Ataturk, despite multiple attempts at leaning westward, had to look east. It was obvious that though he succeeded in having the Turks view themselves as European, the Europeans themselves did not reciprocate the feeling.

When Turkey was established in 1920, Ataturk struggled with allies, had a frail military, and an equally weak economy. He needed all the help he can get. So explains the sudden interest in Islam and Communism from 1920--1923. The return to Pan-Islamic rhetoric helped rally non-Turkish troops to fight in the Turkish military (Kurds, Circassians) as well as secure funding from the Indian Islamic Khilifat (Indian Muslim Movement). Equally crucial (and disingenuous) was the sudden interest in Marxism, used to ally with Russia and counteract the Western military might. Without Russian military assistance it is likely a young Turkish republic would have been taken over by their Greek neighbors during their early wars.

Interestingly, these policies weren't just foreign policy, but domestic as well. By allying himself to the Islamic and Marxist factions, Ataturk was preempting internal dissent through such ideologies.

## Reforming the Young Republic

Once Turkey had the military and economic basis it needed to ensure its survival, Ataturk turned his attention to reforming the nation. Despite the hardships introduced by the West, Ataturk continued to steer the ship of the young nation towards Europe. Sundays rather than Fridays became the day off work, the alphabet became based off a Latin script, the use of the traditional Ottoman Fez was discouraged in favor of Western hats, and the calendar became based of the Gregorian AD/BC dates.

In private and amongst elite circles Ataturk was critical of religion, saying "religion the science of the masses, science is the religion of the elite". Religion to him was a myth of fabrication by Muslim tradition with many practices adopted from Judaism.

Despite these internal quarrels with religion, Ataturk realized he would never rid his nation of religion. Rather than fight it, he sought to use it and control the message. Mustafa Kemal first separated the (Ottoman) sultanate from the caliphate (separating religion and state) before removing the caliphate altogether (a power vacuum later seized by the Saudis). He then established the Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs to communicate directly with the public on a more 'Turkish' version of Islam.

Another interesting aspect of Ataturk's reforms are in the rights of women in the young Republic compared to the late Ottoman era. In the young Turkish Republic, women were outwardly free, dressed as their western counterparts, but also trapped by the same Victorian principles; all the while the state patted themselves back on their "progressiveness". Under the late Ottoman Empire women were visibly less "free", wearing religious garb (often by choice), with a strong feminist movement and an active role in the economy.

## Mystery Solved?

So who was Ataturk and how should we view his legacy? Ask 5 people and I am sure you would get 50 responses. Ataturk took a dying empire and created a modernized Republic, an extraordinary accomplishment to be sure. He is often revered as a remarkable man, and in many ways he was, but he was also hypocritical in his views on science, religion, and Westernization. Best described as a pragmatist, Ataturk --- the father of Turkey --- did whatever it took to ensure his Republics longevity.
