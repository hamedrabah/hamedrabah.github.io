## Why Cloud Gaming
Ever since the advent of Netflix and the video streaming era, people have begun to wonder: can the same be done for video games? Could it be possible to stream a modern video game to a low power computer, and play it in real time?
First let me start with why this matters. Cloud gaming isn’t just about hardcore gamers (large a demographic as they are) being able to instantly upgrade their advanced computers to the latest and greatest graphics cards. That is one part of it, but it’s not the most important. First and foremost cloud gaming is about accessibility.
Before I get into computers, I want to discuss the alternative: consoles. Part of the reason consoles are so popular is they are
it is cheaper to purchase a console ($200–300) than a full fledged gaming computer (often upwards of $1,000)
simpler, there is a much lower barrier to entry to purchase 1 console box than to buy a gaming computer, or just as common for gamers: building a computer piece by piece
Cloud gaming solves both of these problems.
## The Promise of Cloud
When video games are able to be streamed over the cloud it lowers the barrier of entry to video games. No longer will potential gamers have to buy expensive hardware to enjoy games!
Admittedly the solution is not perfect, one could argue that cloud gaming simply shifts the cost away from hardware over to high quality internet speeds. This is a valid criticism, however, on balance purchasing something as versatile as internet (at a much lower monthly cost than a computer) is better for consumers than an expensive piece of hardware that is limited to video games and perhaps GPU demanding applications (i.e. Photoshop, Blender, etc.). I actually think the solution to the latter will also be accomplished via cloud versions of creation software.
The second problem with cloud gaming is that until now, no company has been able to successfully come up with a model that balances expensive server costs, limitations of an diverse array of hardware, and internet requirements sufficient enough to provide a adequate experience but flexible enough to make an accessible service.

## The Solution
I have been a beta tester a product called NVIDIA GeForce Now for the last 2 years. To describe what exactly GeForce Now is, just imagine the power of a Playstation 4, Xbox One, or powerful gaming computer … on a Macbook.
The way it works is similar to streaming a show on Netflix. Your computer streams the video of a game being processed on NVIDIA’s servers. The input from your computer or controller is sent to the servers and from there back to your computer where the video is updated in real time. This is a truly amazing feat of engineering, one only possible in the last few years of GPU advancements paired with a team of engineers and the server knowledge few in the industry possess today.

The product is not perfect, the UI is clumsy. It designed in a way that promotes playing games featured on the application’s landing screen, and there is no easy way for users to import their existing game libraries into Geforce Now. This can make it hard for a casual user to tell which games are supported for streaming, which could lead to cases where a user mistakenly purchases an unsupported game.
Another problem is how NVIDIA handles server bottlenecks. During popular gaming time periods, it is not unusual for a user to have their game screen abruptly disturbed by a notification with a countdown timer informing them they only have a few minutes to end their game. This can be a frustration point for many users, especially those who do not have the option to save their game or are playing a multiplayer game with friends. Going forward NVIDIA should try to create a more transparent experience for their users, one that tells them how long they have access to the servers from the beginning, and warns users to save their game if the servers are experiencing abnormal traffic.
Despite these limitations, NVIDIA GeForce is without a doubt the best thing to happen to gamers in the last 10 years. They have done what other companies (Onlive, Playstation Now, etc.) have failed to do. Create a seamless, ubiquitous (accessible to more people not just those who can afford expensive computers), cloud gaming experience for users of any hardware device. The level of innovation shown in NVIDIA’s engineering is just starting to get matched with rivals such as Microsoft’s project xCloud and Amazon’s upcoming secretive cloud gaming service. For this 0 to 1 level of product ingenuity I am proud to say that GeForce Now took my breath away, and I am excited to see what the future of gaming holds.
